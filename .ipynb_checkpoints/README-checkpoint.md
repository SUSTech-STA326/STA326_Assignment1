# Assignment 1: Data Collection

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: To understand and apply different methods of data collection, analysis, and cleaning across various data formats.
- **Key Skills**: Web Scraping, JSON and CSV Data Handling, Data Cleaning, Python Programming.

## Introduction

The project is structured into four key tasks, starting with web scraping to collect raw data from websites, followed by analyzing pre-collected data in JSON and CSV formats, and concluding with a crucial data cleaning step to ensure data quality.  Try to understand and finish the tasks in [Assignment1](assignment1.ipynb).
