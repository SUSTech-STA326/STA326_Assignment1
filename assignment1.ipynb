    "Post data collection, a pivotal step ensues—Data Cleaning. This phase is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of our analysis. It involves scrutinizing the data for inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and incompleteness. Techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors are employed to refine the dataset. A common phenomenon is that the collected data may contain missing values. Here are two common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonresponse.** For example, people might have left a field blank when responding to a survey, or left the entire survey blank.\n",
    "- **Lost in entry.** Data might have been lost after initial recording. For example, a disk cleanup might accidentally wipe older entries of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, it is **not** appropriate to simply drop missing values from the dataset or pretend that if filled in they would not change your results. In 2016, many polls mistakenly predicted that Hillary Clinton would easily win the Presidential election by committing this error. In this particular dataset, however, the **missing values occur completely at random**. This criteria allows us to drop missing values without significantly affecting our conclusions.\n",
