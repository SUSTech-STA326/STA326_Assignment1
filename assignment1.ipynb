    "\n",
    "1) If you are using another organization's website for scraping, make sure to check the website's terms & conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Do not request data from the website too aggressively (quickly) with your program (also known as spamming), as this may break the website. Make sure your program behaves in a reasonable manner (i.e. acts like a human). One request for one webpage per second is good practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The layout of a website may change from time to time. Because of this, if you're scraping a website, make sure to revisit the site and rewrite your code as needed."

When creating an account, each Tinder user was asked to provide their first name, last name, work email (to verify the disclosed workplace), age, gender, phone # and zip code. Before releasing this data, a data scientist cleaned the data to protect the privacy of Tinder's users by removing the obvious personal identifiers: phone #, zip code, and IP address.

    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you are provided with two data files that contain information on a sample of people. The two files and their columns are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `age_steps.csv`: Contains one row for each person.\n",
    "    - `id`: Unique identifier for the person.\n",
    "    - `age`: Age of the person.\n",
    "    - `steps`: Number of steps the person took on average in January 2018.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- `incomes.json`: Contains one record for each person.\n",
    "    - `id`: Unique identifier for the person. Two records with the same ID between `age_steps.csv` and `incomes.json` correspond to the same person.\n",
    "    - `last_name`: Last name of the person.\n",
    "    - `first_name`: First name of the person.\n",
    "    - `income`: Income of the person in 2018.\n",
    "    \n",
    "You can find the given data under the folder `'./data/task3'`. To finish the assignment, we recommend looking at the official 10 minutes to pandas guide: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html"

It involves scrutinizing the data for inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and incompleteness. Techniques such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting errors are employed to refine the dataset. A common phenomenon is that the collected data may contain missing values. Here are two common ones:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nonresponse.** For example, people might have left a field blank when responding to a survey, or left the entire survey blank.\n",

In this particular dataset, however, the **missing values occur completely at random**. This criteria allows us to drop missing values without significantly affecting our conclusions.\n",
